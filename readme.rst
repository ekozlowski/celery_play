celery_play
===========

Building an example of an image resizing backend using Celery for image processing.

Not getting fancy with the spices, just being really simple in deferring workloads.

I will be covering this in a talk at DFW Pythoneers monthly meeting on Saturday,
October 10, 2015 at Improving Enterprises.

Requirements
============

- Written on Mac OS X, Yosemite
- Vagrant (tested with 1.7.4)
- Virtualbox (tested with 5.0.4)

Should I use this in Production?
================================

No.  Google "No No Cat".  :)

Can I use this?
===============

Sure, but you assume all responsibility.
